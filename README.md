# Go Translator Service

This program is implemented by reading https://gobyexample.com/ and other
resourses, found on Internet, picking up knowledge and code from there and
adapting it for the task.  I have read some parts of some books about Go,
[played a little with it in 2017](https://github.com/kberov/imgresize), but
never used it profesionally.

For sure, if the task grows in details and requirements, it has to be better
structured, for example as a MVC application, but I miss yet the knowledge
about what are the best practices in Go.
