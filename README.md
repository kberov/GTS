# Go Translator Service

This program is implemented by reading https://gobyexample.com/,
https://pkg.go.dev/ and other resourses, found on Internet, picking up
knowledge and code from there and adapting it for the task.  I have prevously
read some parts of some books about Go, [played a little with it in
2017](https://github.com/kberov/imgresize), but never used it profesionally.

For sure, if the task grows in details and requirements, it has to be better
structured, for example as a MVC application, use a framework like
[Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/), but I miss yet the knowledge about what
are the best practices in Go and a lot of knowledge.

I did this for two days. Not bad for an old, average Perl hacker.

# Usage

At the command-line:
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
$ git clone git@github.com:kberov/GTS.git
$ cd GTS
# 2. Run and go to http://localhost:8080 for more.
$ go build && ./GTS -port 8080
